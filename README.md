# Drip Framework

**Drip** is a lightweight **hybrid framework** that blends the **simplicity of PHP** for rendering views with the **performance of Go** for building APIs.  
It is designed for developers who want **fast prototyping** like PHP, while still leveraging the **concurrency and speed of Go** for backend services.
